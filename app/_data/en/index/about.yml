description: "The Wearable Data Hack Munich 2015 is the first hack day on wearable tech applications and data.<BR><BR>It will take place right after Apple Watch will be out. We aim to kick-off app development for the emerging smartwatch and wearable tech market. The Wearable Data Hack Munich 2015 will be the first occasion for most of the participants to share their views and ideas and jointly gather experience with the new data realm.<BR><BR>Apple calls the Apple Watch “Our most personal device ever”. And with good cause: The data from wearable tech, smartphones and smartwatches are really the most personal data ever. Our mobile devices accompany every step we take, every move we make. A plentitude of sensors on the devices draw multidimensional pictures of our daily lives. Applications of wearable data range from fitness to retail, from automotive to health. There is hardly an industry that cannot make direct use of it. And yet, wearable apps are still in their childhood. The Apple Watch will be hitting the streets in April and will get the ball rolling."
